# 🧪 Testing "Add to Calendar" Database Save

## What Was Fixed

The "Add to Calendar" button was silently failing to save to the database. I've updated it to:

1. ✅ **Show detailed error messages** if database save fails
2. ✅ **Log to console** for debugging
3. ✅ **Validate organization exists** before saving
4. ✅ **Use proper field names** for database schema
5. ✅ **Handle authentication** properly

## 🧪 How to Test

### **Step 1: Clear Your Console**
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- Clear it (or look for new messages)

### **Step 2: Generate Content**
1. Go to `/suggestions`
2. Click "Generate Suggestions"
3. Wait for AI to generate content

### **Step 3: Add to Calendar**
1. Click "Add to Calendar" on any suggestion
2. **Watch the console** - you should see:

**✅ Success:**
```
Saving to database... {organization_id: "...", title: "...", ...}
✅ Saved to database successfully! {id: "...", ...}
Successfully added to calendar: {...}
```

**❌ Error (you'll see an alert):**
```
Database save failed: [specific error message]
⚠️ Database save failed: [error]
Saved to localStorage only.
```

### **Step 4: Verify in Supabase**
1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → Table Editor → `content_calendar`
2. **Refresh** the table
3. **You should see** the new item!

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: "Please create an organization first"**

**Cause:** No organization in localStorage

**Fix:**
1. Go to `/setup/organization`
2. Fill out the form
3. Click "Save"
4. Verify in Supabase → Table Editor → `organizations`
5. Try adding to calendar again

---

### **Issue 2: "Unauthorized" error**

**Cause:** User not logged in

**Fix:**
1. Check you're logged in (see your name in top right)
2. If not, logout and login again
3. Try adding to calendar again

---

### **Issue 3: "new row violates check constraint"**

**Cause:** Platform name doesn't match allowed values

**Error example:**
```
new row violates check constraint "content_calendar_platform_check"
```

**Allowed platforms:**
- `facebook`
- `instagram`
- `linkedin`
- `google_analytics`
- `google_ads`
- `tiktok`
- `twitter`
- `csv_upload`

**Fix:** The code now converts to lowercase automatically. If this still happens, check the console to see what platform value was sent.

---

### **Issue 4: "organization_id does not exist"**

**Cause:** Organization exists in localStorage but not in database

**Fix:**
1. Go to `/setup/organization`
2. Update any field (e.g., add a space to the name)
3. Click "Save" (this will sync to database)
4. Check Supabase → `organizations` table
5. Try adding to calendar again

---

### **Issue 5: Silent failure (no error, but not in database)**

**Cause:** API route might be returning 401 Unauthorized

**Debug:**
1. Open Network tab in DevTools
2. Click "Add to Calendar"
3. Look for `/api/calendar` request
4. Check the response:
   - **401:** Not authenticated
   - **500:** Server error
   - **201:** Success!

## 🔍 Debug Checklist

Run through this checklist:

- [ ] **User is logged in** (name appears in top right)
- [ ] **Organization exists in database:**
  ```sql
  SELECT id, name FROM organizations;
  ```
- [ ] **User is linked to organization:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM organization_members;
  ```
- [ ] **Platform name is valid** (lowercase, one of the allowed values)
- [ ] **All required fields are present** (title, posting_date, platform, etc.)

---

## 📊 Verify Database Save

After clicking "Add to Calendar", run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check most recent calendar item
SELECT 
  id,
  title,
  posting_date,
  platform,
  status,
  created_at
FROM content_calendar 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

You should see your newly added item! ✅
