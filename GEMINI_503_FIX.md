# Gemini API 503 Error Fix

## Problem
The Gemini API was intermittently returning **503 Service Unavailable** errors, causing content generation to fail and fall back to hardcoded suggestions.

## Root Causes
1. **Rate Limits**: Gemini API has rate limits (requests per minute/day)
2. **Service Overload**: Temporary API service overload
3. **Network Issues**: Transient network connectivity problems
4. **API Quota**: Free tier quota limitations

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**
Added a retry mechanism that:
- Attempts the API call up to **3 times**
- Uses **exponential backoff** (2s, 4s, 8s delays)
- Only retries on **503 errors** (not other errors)
- Fails fast on non-retryable errors

```typescript
async function retryWithBackoff<T>(
  fn: () => Promise<T>,
  maxRetries = 3,
  baseDelay = 1000
): Promise<T>
```

### 2. **Enhanced Error Reporting**
Now provides:
- Clear distinction between temporary (503) and permanent errors
- Retry suggestions for users
- Debug information including retry attempts
- Better error context

### 3. **Improved Fallback System**
When Gemini fails after retries:
- Returns fallback suggestions with `generated_by: 'fallback'`
- Includes error details and retry suggestions
- Maintains user experience continuity

## API Response Examples

### Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "suggestions": [...],
  "generated_by": "gemini",
  "organization_context": {...},
  "website_content_used": true
}
```

### Fallback Response (After 503 Retries)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "suggestions": [...],
  "generated_by": "fallback",
  "error": "Gemini API failed: Gemini API error: 503 Service Unavailable",
  "retry_suggestion": "The Gemini API is temporarily unavailable (503). This is usually temporary - try again in a few moments.",
  "debug_info": {
    "error_type": "Error",
    "is_retryable": true,
    "retries_attempted": 3,
    "api_key_configured": true,
    "api_key_length": 39
  }
}
```

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. **Monitor API Usage**
Check your Gemini API quota in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/):
- Free tier: 15 requests per minute, 1,500 per day
- Consider upgrading if you hit limits frequently

### 2. **Implement Caching** (Future Enhancement)
Cache generated suggestions for similar requests to reduce API calls:
```typescript
// Example: Cache suggestions by organization + objectives hash
const cacheKey = `suggestions_${orgId}_${objectivesHash}`;
```

### 3. **Add Rate Limiting** (Future Enhancement)
Implement client-side rate limiting to prevent hitting API limits:
```typescript
// Example: Queue requests with delays
const requestQueue = new PQueue({ 
  concurrency: 1, 
  interval: 5000, // 5 seconds between requests
  intervalCap: 1 
});
```

### 4. **User Feedback**
Update the UI to show:
- Loading state with retry indicators
- Clear messages when using fallback suggestions
- Option to manually retry when 503 occurs

## Testing
To test the retry logic:
1. Generate content suggestions multiple times
2. Monitor the console for retry logs
3. Check if fallback occurs less frequently
4. Verify error messages are clearer

## Monitoring
Watch your Vercel logs for:
- `Retry 1/3 after 2000ms due to 503 error`
- `Retry 2/3 after 4000ms due to 503 error`
- `Retry 3/3 after 8000ms due to 503 error`

These indicate the retry mechanism is working.

## Files Modified
- `src/app/api/llm/content-suggestions/route.ts`
  - Added `retryWithBackoff` function
  - Wrapped Gemini API call with retry logic
  - Enhanced error handling and reporting

## Deployment
The fix has been implemented and tested. Deploy to Vercel:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add retry logic for Gemini API 503 errors"
git push origin main
```
